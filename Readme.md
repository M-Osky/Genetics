Scripts I use for handling genetic data. Most of them can be called asking for help to see the usage

maker_structure will create multiple Structure submission files for a range of parameters
Also the file to submit them all

popmap_maker will crate a popmap file that lots of softwares (Stacks, FastStructure..) will ask for. It will consider that the name of your files include the population and the sample name. I recommend to use first fixnumeration.pl if needed

save_signif_loci is a shameful script I did to extract loci with significant pair-wise Fst from the general file
